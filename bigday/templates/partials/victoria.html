            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>Victoria is located on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, just north of the U.S.–Canada border and across the water from Seattle.</p>
			<p>
                Guests traveling from the United States may find it most convenient to fly to Victoria International Airport (YYJ) via Seattle (SEA) or Vancouver (YVR), 
                or to take a seaplane flight from downtown Seattle to Victoria’s Inner Harbour. Another popular option is the FRS Clipper passenger 
                ferry, which runs from downtown Seattle directly to downtown Victoria. These sea and air routes avoid driving and offer a scenic 
                approach to the city. <b>Please remember to bring a valid passport and allow time for customs and border processing.</b> Also make sure you are aware of <a href="https://www.help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1409?language=en_US">reasons Canada may deny you entry.</a>

            <h3>Things to Do</h3>
            <p>
            Victoria is one of our favorite places in the world. It’s a city we think of often—calm, beautiful,
            and shaped by the sea and the gardens that surround it. We feel incredibly fortunate to share it
            with you and hope you’ll have time to slow down, wander, and experience it in your own way.
            </p>

            <h3>Eat</h3>
            <p>
            Food in Victoria is thoughtful and seasonal, shaped by the surrounding land and water.
            Many of our favorite places are within walking distance downtown and around the Inner Harbour.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Marilena Cafe &amp; Raw Bar</strong> – Refined, ingredient-driven dining</li>
            <li><strong>II Terrazzo</strong> and <strong>IL Covo Trattoria</strong> – Warm, well-loved Italian restaurants</li>
            <li><strong>Finn’s Seafood Chops Cocktails</strong> and <strong>Shuck Taylor’s</strong> – Local seafood and oysters</li>

            <h3>Drink</h3>
            <p>
            Victoria’s drinking culture is relaxed and welcoming. Historic pubs sit alongside intimate cocktail bars,
            many in beautifully restored buildings.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Citrus &amp; Cane</strong> and <strong>Humboldt Bar</strong> – Thoughtful cocktails</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Walking Tours</h3>
            <p>
            Victoria reveals itself best on foot. Its scale invites wandering, and its history shows up in quiet corners
            as much as in landmarks.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Hidden Victoria Tours</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Toonie Tours Victoria</strong></li>

            </ul>
            <p>
            Self-guided favorites include the Inner Harbour, Chinatown and Fan Tan Alley, and Bastion Square.
            </p>

            <h3>Butchart Gardens</h3>
            <p>
            Butchart Gardens is one of the places that defines Victoria for us. It’s expansive yet peaceful,
            shaped slowly over time. Wandering the gardens feels meditative, and it’s easy to lose track of the hours.
            </p>

            <h3>Spa</h3>
            <p>
            Rest feels natural here. Victoria offers spaces designed for quiet, warmth, and restoration.

            <li><strong>Fairmont Spa at the Empress</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Heaven The Spa on the Rock</strong>, <strong>Sapphire Day Spa</strong>, and <strong>The Spa Magnolia</strong></li>
            <li><strong>RITUAL Nordic Spa</strong>, <strong>HAVN Saunas</strong>, and <strong>Float House Victoria</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Boathouse Spa</strong> and <strong>Parkside Spa</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Shopping</h3>
            <p>
            Shopping in Victoria is best approached without a plan. It’s less about large stores and more about small discoveries.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Government Street</strong> and the downtown core</li>
            <li><strong>Market Square</strong> and <strong>Trounce Alley</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Chinatown</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Bay Centre</strong></li>
            <li>Local chocolate shops, tea shops, and bakeries throughout downtown</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            We hope this place leaves an impression on you, as it has on us. Thank you for being here,
            and for allowing us to share somewhere that continues to feel like home.
