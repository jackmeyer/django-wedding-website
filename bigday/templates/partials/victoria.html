            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>Victoria is located on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, just north of the U.S.–Canada border and across the water from Seattle.</p>
			<p>
                Guests traveling from the United States may find it most convenient to fly to Victoria International Airport (YYJ) via Seattle (SEA) or Vancouver (YVR), 
                or to take a seaplane flight from downtown Seattle to Victoria’s Inner Harbour. Another popular option is the FRS Clipper passenger 
                ferry, which runs from downtown Seattle directly to downtown Victoria. These sea and air routes avoid driving and offer a scenic 
                approach to the city. <b>Please remember to bring a valid passport and allow time for customs and border processing.</b> Also make sure you are aware of <a href="https://www.help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1409?language=en_US">reasons Canada may deny you entry.</a>
